# one-percent-better
An iOS app written in SwiftUI to visualize and track the progress of habits. The idea behind 1% Better is you can only get at most 1% better at something every day. If you try to get 5% better at something every day, you'll soon run out of steam and burn out. If you only get 0.5% better at something every day, you'll not see enough progress and get bored and quit. This app is designed to help you find your 1% better every day range in order to stay consistent with your habits in the long run.
Features:
- **Improvement Score**: Every time you complete your habit this score will grow 1% bigger, and every time you don't it will decay 0.5% smaller.
- **AI Notifications**: Choose to add notifications at specific times or at random times. Notifications are generated by ChatGPT and tailored to your habits, so no two notifications will be the same!
  - For example, a habit named "Read" will get a notifications like: "C'mon, you promised yourself you'd read." or "Psst! Your novel is feeling lonely. Time to read!"
- **Frequencies**: Pledge to do your habit either multiple times per day, specific days of the week, or multiple times per week without specific days.
- **Trackers**: Attach trackers to your habits, such as:
  - Graph to track a number, such as how many miles you ran.
  - Photo to track visual progress, such as a picture of a plant as it's growing.
  - Exercise, to track the sets of weights and reps you do at the gym
- **Insights**: View cumulative statistics of all your habits, such as a moving average of your daily percent completion rate.
- **Light and Dark Mode**: Choose between the two or to use the system's setting.
